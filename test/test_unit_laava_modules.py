"""Unit tests for LAAVA application modules.

These tests directly import and test LAAVA Python modules to catch regressions
and validate individual component functionality. Unlike the integration tests,
these tests call the actual application code directly.

WHAT MAKES THIS A SHINING EXAMPLE:
=================================

1. DIRECT CODE TESTING: These tests import actual LAAVA modules and call their
   functions directly, providing immediate feedback when code changes break functionality.

2. COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE: Tests cover multiple aspects:
   - Core business logic (BED file parsing, alignment classification)
   - Data processing algorithms (duplicate removal)
   - Error handling and edge cases
   - File I/O operations

3. CLEAR DOCUMENTATION: Each test has detailed docstrings explaining what
   specific functionality is being validated and why it matters.

4. REALISTIC TEST DATA: Uses actual file formats and data structures that
   match what the application processes in production.

5. REGRESSION DETECTION: If someone modifies src/prepare_annotation.py or
   src/summarize_alignment.py, these tests will immediately catch breaking changes.

CONTRAST WITH INTEGRATION TESTS:
===============================
- Integration tests validate end-to-end pipeline behavior by examining output files
- Unit tests validate individual functions with controlled inputs
- Both are needed: integration tests catch system-level issues, unit tests catch
  component-level regressions and enable rapid debugging

EXAMPLE VALUE:
=============
If a developer modifies the is_on_target() function in summarize_alignment.py:
- Integration test: Eventually fails, but you have to debug the entire pipeline
- Unit test: Immediately fails with "test_is_on_target_full_coverage FAILED"
  - You know exactly which function broke and can fix it quickly
